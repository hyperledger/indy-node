# Indy Node

[![Build Status](https://jenkins.evernym.com/buildStatus/icon?job=Sovrin%20Node/master)](https://jenkins.evernym.com/view/Core/job/Sovrin%20Node/job/master/)    

This codebase embodies all the functionality to run nodes--validators and/or observers
that provide a [self-sovereign identity ecosystem](https://sovrin.org) on top of a
distributed ledger. It is the core project for Indy; over time, all other indy-\* projects may
collapse into this one, except for [indy-sdk](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk).

This code is tightly associated with [Sovrin](https://sovrin.org). Sovrin is a public utility
for identity, built on top of this codebase. People who install sovrin packages (e.g., with
`sudo apt install sovrin-node`) get prepackaged genesis transactions that integrate a
with an Indy validator pool using [Sovrin's governance and trust framework](https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SovrinProvisionalTrustFramework2017-03-22.pdf). However, it is possible to use Indy Node
with a different network, using whatever conventions a community chooses.

Bugs, stories, and backlog for this codebase are managed in [Hyperledger's Jira](https://jira.hyperledger.org).
Use project name INDY.

Today, documentation for Indy is sparse. Most materials that exist were written for Sovrin. Therefore,
we recommend that developers should explore Sovrin's [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin-client/blob/master/getting-started.md) to learn about Indy Node basics. In the future, documentation
will be part of [indy-sdk](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk).

Have a look at [Setup Instructions](https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin-client/blob/master/setup.md)
to understand how to work with the code. Note that setup instructions are
still changing hour-by-hour as we identify
install preconditions.
