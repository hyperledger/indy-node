### Upgrade Scripts:

**Pool upgrade should be performed simultaneously for all nodes due to txn format changes.**

**All indy-cli pools should be recreated with actual genesis files.**

#### CLI Upgrading:

**Old CLI (`indy`):**

upgrade from 1.3 to 1.4 version
delete `~.ind-cli/networks/&lt;network_name&gt;/data` folder
replace both old genesis files by new ones (from 1.4 node)

**New CLI (`indy-cli`):**

upgrade from 1.4 to 1.5 version
recreate indy-cli pool using 1.4 pool genesis file (from 1.4 node)

### Additional Information:

**List of breaking changes for migration from indy-node 1.3 to 1.4:**

https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/1.3\_to\_1.4\_migration\_guide.md

**IndyNode 1.4 and LibIndy 1.5 compatibility:**

_General_

By default LibIndy 1.5 will be compatible with IndyNode 1.3 (current stable), and not 1.4 (the new one).

LibIndy 1.5 can become compatible with IndyNode 1.4 if `indy_set_protocol_version(2)` is called during app initialization.

_Guideline for teams and apps_

Applications can freely update to LibIndy 1.5 and still use stable Node 1.3

If an app wants to work with the latest master or Stable Node 1.4, then they need to support breaking changes (there are not so many, mostly a new reply for write txns as txn format is changed, see 1.3\_to\_1.4\_migration\_guide.md)

call `indy_set_protocol_version(2)` during app initialization

Use https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/b4a2bb82087e2eafe5e55bddb20a3069e5fb7d0b/cli/README.md#old-python-based-cli-migration to export dids from your old CLI wallet to the new one (new indy-cli).

#### Upgrade Steps


1. Send Pool Upgrade command so all nodes upgrade.

2. Sometime later each Steward will need to do the following steps to add their BLS Keys:

##### Steps to Add BLS Keys

**_From the Validator Node:_**

1. Generate a new 32-byte seed for the bls key (we recommend pwgen):

``$ sudo apt install pwgen``

``$ pwgen -s -y -B 32 1``

If the output has a single-quote symbol ('), rerun until it doesn't.

**NOTE: This is not your Steward or Node seed.**

2. Record the seed **somewhere secure**.

3. Switch to the indy user.

``$ sudo su - indy``

4. Configure the BLS key.

``$ init_bls_keys --name <NODE_ALIAS> --seed '<SEED>'``

The ``--seed`` is the seed you generated above, and will be used to create the BLS key.

_Example with Seed:_

 ``$ init_bls_keys --name Node1 --seed 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'``

Capture the stdout at the end of the output, which looks like the following, and record it.

`BLS Public key is 3AfkzUZVn2WT9mxW2zQXMgX39FXSY5qzohnMVpdvNS5KSath1YG5Ux4u9ubTFTaP6W55XX9Yx7xPWeYos489oyY53WzwNBG7X4o32ESnZ9xacLmNsQLBjqc6oqpWGTbEXv4edFTrZ88n93sEh4fjFhQMumaXxDfWJgd9aj7KCSpf38F`

5. Exit the indy user.

``$ exit ``

**_From the CLI Node:_**

1. Manually upgrade the CLI.

 ``$ sudo apt update``

 ``$ sudo apt upgrade``

2. Launch the CLI.

``$ indy ``

The first time running the upgraded CLI you will be prompted to migrate your previous settings. Answer "Yes."

3. Connect to the pool.

`indy> connect live`

4. Set your Steward as the signer in the CLI.

`indy@live> use DID <Steward DID>`

_Example:_

`indy@live> use DID Th7MpTaRZVRYnPiabds81Y`

**Note:** If your DID is not found in the wallet, you will need to use your steward seed:

`indy@live> new key with seed <steward_seed>`

5. Now you will send a node transaction like what you did when you added the node to the pool. You will add the BLS key as a new parameter to the transaction to update the pool ledger with this additional public key. For 'dest', use the same base58 value for this that was used when you initially onboarded your VM onto the provisional pool.

`indy@live> send NODE dest=<node_dest> data={'alias':'<node name>','blskey': '<key_generated_by_init_bls_keys>'}`

_Example:_

`indy@live> send NODE dest=Gw6pDLhcBcoQesN72qfotTgFa7cbuqZpkX3Xo6pLhPhv data={'alias':'Node1','blskey': '3AfkzUZVn2WT9mxW2zQXMgX39FXSY5qzohnMVpdvNS5KSath1YG5Ux4u9ubTFTaP6W55XX9Yx7xPWeYos489oyY53WzwNBG7X4o32ESnZ9xacLmNsQLBjqc6oqpWGTbEXv4edFTrZ88n93sEh4fjFhQMumaXxDfWJgd9aj7KCSpf38F'}`

**Note:** The 'node_dest' value can be found on the node with `sudo read_ledger --type pool`.


#### Questions and Answers

##### BLS Keys for State Proofs


**What does BLS stand for?**

Boneh-Lynn-Shacham - The BLS signature scheme is used to verify that a signer is authentic.

**How does the CLI use State Proof for confirmation?**

When the CLI requests information about a transaction it checks the BLS signatures to verify the transaction was written by nodes that are part of the validator pool. The CLI sends a request to one node (arbitrary one). If the Reply doesn't have a State Proof, or the reply is incorrect/invalid, then CLI falls back to sending requests to all Nodes and waiting for f+1 equal Replies.

**What if not all nodes in the pool have BLS signing keys for a transaction?**

Transactions only get signed if all nodes reaching consensus can sign it (>= n-f Nodes with correct BLS signatures).

**Can the bls_seed be any 32 character seed like the Steward seed?**

Yes.

**When adding a new node to an existing pool where do I find my BLS key?**

When initializing your node using `init_indy_node` the output will display the keys for the node including the BLS key. It can be found in /var/lib/indy/<network_name>/keys/<node_name>/bls_keys/bls_pk file (e.g.: /var/lib/indy/sandbox/keys/Node1/bls_keys/bls_pk)

When you send the transaction to add the new node to the pool it will also contain the BLS key in the transaction shown in this example.

*Example of send node command with BLS for 5th node in test pool:*

 ``send NODE dest=4Tn3wZMNCvhSTXPcLinQDnHyj56DTLQtL61ki4jo2Loc data=
{'client_port': 9702, 'client_ip': '10.0.0.105', 'alias': 'Node5', 'node_ip': '10.0.0.105', 'node_port': 9701, 'services': ['VALIDATOR'], 'blskey':'2RdajPq6rCidK5gQbMzSJo1NfBMYiS3e44GxjTqZUk3RhBdtF28qEABHRo4MgHS2hwekoLWRTza9XiGEMRCompeujWpX85MPt87WdbTMysXZfb7J1ZXUEMrtE5aZahfx6p2YdhZdrArFvTmFWdojaD2V5SuvuaQL4G92anZ1yteay3R'}``

**Can I use a seed when generating my BLS keys?**

For a new node when using `init_indy_node` if you specify a seed for this script that same seed is used to generate your BLS keys.

**For existing nodes** being upgraded to 1.2.50, which includes state proofs, you would use the script `init_bls_keys` where you can specify a 32-character seed on the command line.

 ``init_bls_keys --name <NODE_ALIAS> --seed '<SEED>'``

After running `init_bls_keys`, Stewards of existing nodes will be required use their CLI node to update their validator's information on the ledger to include the bls keys:

 ``send NODE dest=<node_dest> data={'alias':'<node name>', 'blskey': '<key_generated_by_init_bls_keys>'}``

##### Multi-network and indy_config.py

**Where do I find the configuration file settings?**

With file and folder changes the new location for `indy_config.py` is in the directory location /etc/indy/. The configuration file has a new setting called ``"NETWORK_NAME"`` which is used to identify which network and associated genesis transaction files to use, such as `sandbox` or `live`. If adding a new node to a live pool, change this setting before initializing the node.
The genesis files are now located in their own directory based off the network name "/var/lib/indy/NETWORK_NAME". The defaults are `live`, `local`, and `sandbox`. Setting the ``"NETWORK_NAME"`` in the `indy_config.py` file will determine which network is used. The default setting in the `indy_config.py` file is "``"NETWORK_NAME=sandbox"``.

### Changes - Additions - Known Issues

| Description | Workaround | Ticket |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **New ledger serialization is supported and Leveldb is used as a storage for all ledgers** : msgpack is used for the ledger serialization (both transaction log and merkle tree). |   |   |
| **The new serialization change created changes to the directory structure for the nodes.** The directory name changes are located on a node under .sovrin/data/nodes/&lt;node name&gt;/&lt;directories&gt;. The change removes the ledger files as plain text files and creates them as binary files. A new tool was created to view the ledger entries called `read_ledger`. This tool also provides you with a count of the transactions. To learn more about this tool and to see a list of available commands, run this as the sovrin user: `read_ledger --h` | | |
| **Genesis transaction files are renamed adding a \_genesis to the end of each file name.** |   |   |
| **Added the commands to the POOL\_UPGRADE to support downgrade and re-installation.** However both have issues and should not be used at this time. |   | [INDY-735](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-735) [INDY-755](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-755) |
| **Fixes to upgrade procedure, in particular an issue which caused an infinite loop.** |   | [INDY-316](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-316) |
| **A new CLI command was added to ease the process of rotating a verification key (verkey).** The command is `change current key` or `change current key with seed xxxxx`. |   |   |
| **Improvements to log messages.** |   |   |
|  In your sources.list you only need the entry &quot;deb https://repo.evernym.com/deb xenial stable&quot;. |   |   |
| **Implemented a command line tool to provide validator status.** |   | [INDY-715](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-715) |
| **&quot;Debug&quot; mode for tests was moved to parameter.** |   | [INDY-716](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-716) |
| **Log levels were changed on some debug level messages to an info level.** |   | [INDY-800](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-800) |
| **If the pool loses enough nodes and cannot reach consensus when enough nodes become available, the pool will still not reach consensus.** | If you restart all the nodes in the pool, it will start reaching consensus again. | [INDY-849](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-849) |
