# Installing the `indy-cli`

The `indy-cli` is developed under the [indy-cli-rs](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-cli-rs). This documentation may be not up to date.


You will need to perform the following once for each `indy-cli` machine you would like to set up (only 1 is required). 
It is recommended that you install the `indy-cli` in your native work environment if possible, so you always have it available even when traveling. 

## Installing `indy-cli-rs`
To install `indy-cli-rs` simply download the latest release from its release pages and unpack it.

## Containerized `indy-cli` Environment

The following sections describe how to install and configure the `indy-cli` directly on a machine or VM. However, possibly the most convenient option is to use a containerized `indy-cli` environment like the one included with [von-network](https://github.com/bcgov/von-network).  For information on how to use the containerized `indy-cli` in `von-network`, refer to [Using the containerized indy-cli](https://github.com/bcgov/von-network/blob/main/docs/Indy-CLI.md)
