## What Indy is, and Why it Matters

The Indy code base (Indy) is a software ecosystem for private, secure, and powerful identity. Once it is implemented, it puts people — not the organizations that traditionally centralize identity — in charge of decisions about their own privacy and disclosure. This enables all kinds of rich innovation: connection contracts, revocation, novel payment workflows, asset and document management features, creative forms of escrow, curated reputation, integrations with other cool technologies, and so on.

Indy uses open-source, distributed ledger technology. These ledgers are a form of database that is provided cooperatively by a pool of participants, instead of by a giant database with a central admin. Data lives redundantly in many places, and it accrues in transactions orchestrated by many machines. Strong, industry-standard cryptography protects it. Best practices in key management and cybersecurity pervade its design. The result is a reliable, public source of truth under no single entity’s control, robust to system failure, resilient to hacking, and highly immune to subversion by hostile entities.

If the cryptography and blockchain details feel mysterious, fear not: this guide will help introduce you to key concepts within Indy. You’re starting in the right place.

## What We’ll Cover

Our goal is to introduce you to many of the concepts of Indy, and give you some idea of what happens behind the scenes to make it all work.

We are going to frame the exploration with a story. Alice, a graduate of the fictional Faber College, wants to apply for a job at the fictional company Acme Corp. As soon as she has the job, she wants to apply for a loan so she can buy a car. She would like to use her college transcript as proof of her education on the job application; once hired, Alice would like to use the fact of employment as evidence of her creditworthiness for the loan.

The sorts of identity and trust interactions required to pull this off are messy in the world today; they are slow, they violate privacy, and they are susceptible to fraud. We’ll show you how Indy is a quantum leap forward.

Ready?

## Alice Gets a Transcript

As a graduate of Faber College, Alice receives an alumni newsletter where she learns that her alma mater is offering digital transcripts. She logs in to the college alumni website and requests her transcript by clicking **Get Transcript**.  (Other ways to initiate this request might include scanning a QR code, downloading a transcript package from a published URL, etc.)

Faber College has done some prep work to offer this service to Alice. It has the role of **trust anchor** on the ledger. (The ledger is created when the Indy code base is implemented.) A trust anchor is a person or organization that the ledger already knows about, that is able to help bootstrap others. (It is *not* the same as what cybersecurity experts call a "trusted third party"; think of it more like a facilitator). Becoming a trust anchor is beyond the scope of this guide; for now, we’ll just assume that Faber College has jumped through some hoops and has the status.

Alice doesn’t realize it yet, but in order to use this digital transcript she will need a new type of identity -- not the traditional identity that Faber College has built for her in its on-campus database, but a new and portable one that belongs to her, independent of all past and future relationships, that nobody can revoke or co-opt or correlate without her permission. This is a **_self-sovereign identity_** and it is the core feature of the ledger.

In normal contexts, managing a self-sovereign identity will require a tool such as a desktop or mobile application. It might be a standalone app, or it might leverage a third party service provider that the ledger calls an **agency**. For example, leaders in this technology such as the Sovrin Foundation and companies like Evernym, publish reference versions of such tools. Faber College will have studied these requirements and will recommend an **_Indy app_** to Alice if she doesn’t already have one; this app will install as part of the workflow from the **Get Transcript** button.

When Alice clicks **Get Transcript**, she will download a file that holds an Indy **connection request**. This connection request file, having a .indy extension and associated with her Indy app, will allow her to establish a secure channel of communication with another party in the ledger ecosystem -- Faber College.

So when Alice clicks **Get Transcript**, she will normally end up installing an app (if needed), launching it, and then being asked by the app whether she wants to accept a request to connect with Faber.

For this guide, however, we’ll be using a command-line interface instead of an app, so we can see what happens behind the scenes. We will pretend to be a particularly curious and technically adventurous Alice…

## Install Indy

You can install a test network in one of several ways:

 - **Automated VM Creation with Vagrant** [Create virtual machines](environment/vagrant/training/vb-multi-vm/TestIndyClusterSetup.md) using VirtualBox and Vagrant.

 - **Docker:** [Start Pool and Client with Docker](environment/docker/pool/StartIndyAgents.md).

 - **Also coming soon:** Create virtual machines in AWS.

To proceed past this point, you should have a test Indy Validator cluster running, either in separate nodes (VMs), or in simulation. You should also have Agent nodes (or a simulation) running with the "Faber College", "Acme Corp", and "Thrift Bank" Agents in separate terminals.  You should also have a CLI client which gives you a command-line interface(CLI) to Indy. We are going to use that CLI to explore what Indy can do. (Indy also has a programmatic API, but it is not yet fully formalized, and this version of the guide doesn’t document it.)

## Using the Indy CLI

After completing the preceding, you should have a terminal with an Indy client CLI prompt:

```
indy>
```

The CLI could play the role of multiple **identity owners** (a person like Alice, an organization like Faber College, or an IoT - style thing; these are often called "principals" in security circles). In this guide we will just be Alice but to keep things clear and explore functionality let's change the prompt:

```
indy> prompt ALICE
ALICE>
```
Next, we will create a new empty wallet for Alice. Creating a new empty wallet basically resets the agent to a clean slate. Because this is the first time you're setting this up, this step is not actually necessary. If you're wanting to interact with other DIDs held by the agent then this does become necessary.

It's a good habit to get into. Go ahead and create the new wallet now:

```
new wallet Alice
```


The 'status' command gives general information about the state of the CLI. Alice tries it:

```
ALICE> status
Not connected to Indy network. Please connect first.

Usage:
    connect(sandbox | live)
```
Alice might also try the 'help' command to see a list of the other commands that are available to her.

## Evaluate a Connection Request

To make this guide more convenient, the Indy CLI package installs a sample Faber College invitation request in a file at /<CLI_ROOT>/sample/faber-request.indy. We’re going to use this file as if it had been downloaded from Faber. (In normal usage, Alice’s Indy app would be doing a lot of these steps automatically.)

```
ALICE> show sample/faber-request.indy
{
  "connection-request": {
    "name": "Faber College",
    "DID": "ULtgFQJe6bjiFbs7ke3NJD",
    "nonce": "b1134a647eb818069c089e7694f63e6d"
  },
  "sig": "4QKqkwv9gXmc3Sw7YFkGm2vdF6ViZz9FKZcNJGh6pjnjgBXRqZ17Sk8bUDSb6hsXHoPxrzq2F51eDn1DKAaCzhqP"
}

Try Next:
    load sample/faber-request.indy
```

Alice sees a bunch of data that looks interesting but mysterious. She wants to know if the connection request file is well formed and has something useful in it, so she uses the 'load' command:

```
ALICE> load sample/faber-request.indy
1 connection request found for Faber College.
Creating Connection for Faber College.

Try Next:
    show connection "Faber College"
    accept request from "Faber College"
```

This causes the client to parse and validate the file in addition to displaying more reader friendly text. Alice would now like to know what’s entailed in accepting the connection request. She types:

```
ALICE> show connection Faber
```

Unlike the 'show' command for files, this one asks the Indy network to show a connection. More details are exposed:

```
Expanding Faber to "Faber College"
Connection (not yet accepted)
    Name: Faber College
    DID: not yet assigned
    Trust anchor: Faber College (not yet written to Indy)
    Verification key: <empty>
    Signing key: <hidden>
    Remote: FuN98eH2eZybECWkofW6A9BKJxxnTatBCopfUiNxo6ZB
    Remote Verification key: <unknown, waiting for sync>
    Remote endpoint: <unknown, waiting for sync>
    Request nonce: b1134a647eb818069c089e7694f63e6d
    Request status: not verified, remote verkey unknown
    Last synced: <this connection has not yet been synchronized>

Try Next:
    sync "Faber College"
    accept request from "Faber College"
```

You’ll see the connection contains several pieces of information. Let’s examine them one at a time.

```
Name: Faber College
```

This is a friendly name for the connection that Alice has been invited to accept. The name is stored locally and not shared. Alice can always rename a connection; its initial value is just provided by Faber for convenience.

```
DID: not yet assigned
```

**DID** (**Decentralized Identifier**) is an opaque, unique sequences of bits, (like UUIDs or GUIDs) that get generated when a user tries to accept the connection request. That DID will be sent to Faber College, and used by Faber College to reference Alice in secure interactions.
 Each connection request on the Indy network establishes a **pairwise relationship** when accepted. A pairwise relationship is a unique relationship between two identity owners (e.g., Faber and Alice). The relationship between them is not shareable with others; it is unique to those two parties in that each pairwise relationship uses different DIDs. (In other circles you may see this defined as two sets of data working in conjunction with each other to perform a specific function, such as in a "public" key and a "private" key working together. This is _not_ how it is defined within the Indy code base.) Alice won’t use this DID with other relationships. By having independent pairwise relationships, Alice reduces the ability for others to correlate her activities across multiple interactions.

```
Trust anchor: Faber College(not yet written to Indy)
```

This gives Alice a friendly name for the entity that will bootstrap the new pairwise relationship onto the ledger. **Trust anchors** provide a way for DIDs to be added to to the ledger. They are generally organizations but can be persons as well. Faber College is a trust anchor, and if its connection request is accepted, will write Alice’s DID to the ledger.

It is important to understand that this DID for Alice is not, in and of itself, the same thing as Alice’s self-sovereign identity. Rather, Alice’s identity will -- for her -- be the sum total of **_all_** of the pairwise relationships she has, and **_all_** the attributes knowable about those manifestations of her identity, across the full network.

If Alice accepts this connection request, she will have a self-sovereign identity by virtue of the fact that she is accessible on the network through at least one relationship. In this case Faber College will be creating the first of many independent relationships that will participate in Alice’s overall identity--but Alice’s identity will not be captive to Faber College in any way.

```
Verification key: <empty>
```

Alice’s **verification key** allows the ledger, the network, and Faber College to trust, in cryptographic operations, that interactions with Alice are authentically bound to her as sender or receiver. It is an [ asymmetric public key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), in cryptographic terms, and the Indy CLI generated this value randomly when it loaded the connection request.

The verification key is a 32 byte Ed25519 verification key. Ed25519 is a particular [elliptic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_cryptography), and is the default signature scheme for the Indy code base.

The verification key has a subtle relationship with the DID value a couple lines above it in the CLI output.

There are three options possible for a verification key associated with a DID:

- **Empty.** There is no verkey (verification key) associated with a DID, and the DID is a **NCID** (non-cryptographic identifier). In this case, the creator of the identity record (the trust anchor) controls the DID, and no independent proof-of-existence is possible until either an Abbreviated or Full verkey is created.

- **Abbreviated.** In this case, there is a verkey starting with a tilde '~' followed by 22 or 23 characters. The tilde indicates that the DID itself represents the first 16 bytes of the verkey and the string following the tilde represents the second 16 bytes of the verkey, both using base58Check encoding.

- **Full.** In this case, there is a full 44 character verkey, representing a base58Check encoding of all 32 bytes of a Ed25519 verification key.

In this guide, an Abbreviated key will be created and used by Alice (you'll notice the `~` prefix for the verification key later in the guide).

The key that Alice uses to interact with Faber can change if she revokes or rotates it, so accepting this connection request and activating this connection doesn’t lock Alice into permanent use of this key. [Key management events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_management) are discoverable in the ledger by parties such as Faber College; we’ll touch on that later in the guide.

```
Signing key: < hidden >
```

A different **signing key** is used by Alice to interact with each party on the ledger (Faber College in this case). A signing key is an asymmetric private key, in cryptographic terms, and the Indy CLI also generated this value when it loaded the connection request. Alice will sign her messages to Faber College with this key, but she will never transmit the signing key anywhere. Because she signs with this key, Faber College can use the associated verification key and know it’s really dealing with Alice.

It’s important that _this signing key is kept secret,_ as someone with this key can impersonate Alice. If this key is ever compromised, Alice can replace it with a new one using several methods not covered here.

```
Remote: FuN98eH2eZybECWkofW6A9BKJxxnTatBCopfUiNxo6ZB
```

**Remote** is the unique DID Alice uses to reference Faber College. Faber College provided this value in the connection request. Alice can use it to look up Faber College’s verification key on the ledger to ensure interactions with Faber College are authentic.

```
Remote Verification key: < unknown, waiting for sync >
```

Communication from the remote can’t be confirmed unless we know its verification key. To know the true verification key of an DID, we have to query the ledger.

Different use cases require different levels of assurance as to how recently we’ve queried the ledger for any key replacements. In this case we might be comfortable if we know that the key was synchronized in the last hour. But we can see that we’ve never synchronized this connection, so we don’t know what the verification key is at all. Until Alice connects to the ledger, she won’t be able to trust communication from Faber College.
```
Remote endpoint: < unknown, waiting for sync >
```

Remotes can have endpoints -- locations (IRIs / URIs / URLs) on the network where others can contact them. These endpoints can be static or they can be ephemeral pseudonymous endpoints facilitated by a third party agency. To keep things simple, we’ll just use static endpoints for now.

```
Request nonce: b1134a647eb818069c089e7694f63e6d
```

This **nonce** is just a big random number that Faber College generated to track the unique connection request. A nonce is a random arbitrary number that can only be used one time. When a connection request is accepted, the invitee digitally signs the nonce such that the inviter can match the acceptance with a prior request.

```
Request status: not verified, remote verification key unknown
```

Requests are signed by the remote. We have a signature, but we don’t yet know Faber College’s verification key, so the signature can’t be proved authentic. We might have a connection request from someone masquerading as Faber College. We’ll resolve that uncertainty when we sync.

```
Last synced: < this connection has not yet been synchronized >
```
A connection stores when it was last synchronized with the Indy ledger, so we can tell how stale some of the information might be. Ultimately, values will be proved current when a transaction is committed to the ledger, so staleness isn’t dangerous -- but it makes the ledger more efficient when identity owners work with up-to-date data.

## Accept a Connection Request

Alice _attempts_ to accept the connection request from Faber College.

```
ALICE> accept request from Faber
Expanding Faber to "Faber College"
Request not yet verified.
Connection not yet synchronized.
Request acceptance aborted.
Cannot sync because not connected. Please connect first.

Usage:
    connect <sandbox|live>
```

In order to accept a connection request, its origin must be proved. Just because a connection request says the sender is "Faber College" doesn’t make it so; the ease of forging email headers is a reminder of why we can’t just trust what a sender says. Syncing the connection with the ledger will allow us to prove the association between Faber College’s identity and public key, but the CLI must be connected to the ledger to sync -- and we haven’t connected yet.

There are two Indy networks we might connect to. One is a sandbox (test) network, and the other is live (production). We’ll use the sandbox (test) network for the demo.

```
ALICE> connect sandbox
 ...
Connected to sandbox.
```

Alice tries again to accept the connection request from Faber College. This time she succeeds.

```
ALICE@sandbox> accept request from Faber
Expanding Faber to "Faber College"

Try Next:
    show claim "Transcript"
    request claim "Transcript"
```
Accepting a connection request takes the nonce that Faber College provided, and signs it with the Alice’s signing key. It then securely transmits the signed data along with the DID and verification key to Faber College’s endpoint, which is discovered when the connection is synchronized. Faber College matches the provided nonce to the record of the nonce it sent to Alice, verifies the signature, then records Alice’s new pairwise DID into the ledger.

Once the connection is accepted and synchronized, Alice inspects it again.

```
ALICE@sandbox> show connection Faber
Expanding Faber to "Faber College"
Connection
    Name: Faber College
    DID: LZ46KqKd1VrNFjXuVFUSY9
    Trust anchor: Faber College (confirmed)

    Signing key: <hidden>
    Remote: FuN98eH2eZybECWkofW6A9BKJxxnTatBCopfUiNxo6ZB
    Remote Verification key: <same as remote>
    Remote endpoint: 10.20.30.101:5555

    Request status: Accepted
    Available Claim(s): Transcript
    Last synced: 14 seconds ago

Try Next:
    show claim "Transcript"
    request claim "Transcript"
```

Notice now that the Last synced line is updated.

Alice can see now that the remote verification key and remote endpoint, as well as DID and verification key are updated, which allows her to communicate with Faber College. She can also see that the identity of the trust anchor was confirmed (from the ledger), and that her connection request has been accepted.

## Test Secure Interaction

At this point Alice is connected to Faber College and can interact in a secure way. The Indy CLI supports a ping command to test secure pairwise interactions. (This command is partly implemented today, and partly still a stub.)

```
ALICE@sandbox> ping Faber
Expanding Faber to "Faber College"

Pinging remote endpoint: ('10.20.30.101', 5555)
    Ping sent.
    Pong received.
```

Alice receives a successful response from Faber College. Here’s what happens behind the scenes:

1. The ping she sends contains a random challenge.

2. The ping also includes Alice’s pairwise DID and a signature.

3. Faber College verifies Alice’s signature.

4. Faber College digitally signs that challenge and sends it back.

5. Alice verifies that the response contained the same random challenge she sent.

6. Alice uses the verification key in the Faber College Connection to verify the Faber College digital signature.

She can trust the response from Faber College because (1) she connects to the current endpoint, (2) no replay - attack is possible, due to her random challenge, (3) she knows the verification key used to verify Faber College’s digital signature is the correct one because she just confirmed it on the ledger.

## Inspect the Claim

Notice that when Alice last showed the Faber connection, there was a new line: ```Available Claim(s): Transcript```. A **claim** is a piece of information about an identity -- a name, an age, a credit score… It is information claimed to be true. In this case, the claim is named, "Transcript".

Claims are offered by an **issuer**. An issuer may be any identity owner known to the ledger and any issuer may issue a claim about any identity owner it can identify. The usefulness and reliability of a claim are tied to the reputation of the issuer with respect to the claim at hand. For Alice to self-issue a claim that she likes chocolate ice cream may be perfectly reasonable, but for her to self-issue a claim that she graduated from Faber College should not impress anyone. The value of this transcript is that it is provably issued by Faber College. Alice wants to use that claim. She asks for more information:

```
ALICE@sandbox> show claim Transcript
Found claim Transcript in connection Faber College
Status: available (not yet issued)
Name: Transcript
Version: 1.2
Attributes:
    student_name
    ssn
    degree
    year
    status

Try Next:
    request claim "Transcript"
```

Alice sees the attributes the transcript contains. These attributes are known because a schema for Transcript has been written to the ledger (see [Appendix](#appendix)). However, the "not yet issued" note means that the transcript has not been delivered to Alice in a usable form. To get the transcript, Alice needs to request it.

```
ALICE@sandbox> request claim Transcript
Found claim Transcript in connection Faber College
Requesting claim Transcript from Faber College...

Signature accepted.

Response from Faber College (34.61 ms):
    Received claim "Transcript".

```

Now the transcript has been issued; Alice has it in her possession, in much the same way that she would hold a physical transcript that had been mailed to her. When she inspects it again, she sees more details:

```
ALICE@sandbox> show claim Transcript
Found claim Transcript in connection Faber College

```

## Apply for a Job

At some time in the future, Alice would like to work for the fictional company, Acme Corp. Normally she would browse to their website, where she would click on a hyperlink to apply for a job. Her browser would download a connection request which her Indy app would open; this would trigger a prompt to Alice, asking her to accept the connection with Acme Corp. Because we’re using a CLI, the interface is different, but the steps are the same. We do approximately the same things that we did when Alice was accepting Faber College’s connection request:

```
ALICE@sandbox> show sample/acme-job-application.indy
{
  "connection-request": {
    "name": "Acme Corp",
    "DID": "CzkavE58zgX7rUMrzSinLr",
    "nonce": "57fbf9dc8c8e6acde33de98c6d747b28c",
    "endpoint": "127.0.0.1:1213"
  },
  "proof-requests": [{
    "name": "Job-Application",
    "version": "0.2",
    "attributes": {
        "first_name": "string",
        "last_name": "string",
        "phone_number": "string",
        "degree": "string",
        "status": "string",
        "ssn": "string"
    },
    "verifiableAttributes": ["degree", "status", "ssn"]
  }],
  "sig": "oeGeMdt5HRjRsbaXybGpRmkkijhHrGT82syxofEJQbkjTCLW63tM3jMn1boaf62vCSEEDyTaVJZnrpfDXAHtLZ9"
}

Try Next:
    load sample/acme-job-application.indy
```

Notice that this connection request contains a **proof request**. A proof request is a request made by the party who needs verifiable proof of certain attributes that can be provided by other verified claims. (Some attributes can be marked so that they must be verified by other proven claims -- like a SSN -- and some attributes can be self-attested to -- like a nickname.)

In this case, Acme Corp is requesting that Alice provide a Job Application. The Job Application is a rich document type that has a schema defined on the ledger; its particulars are outside the scope of this guide, but it will require a name, SSN, and degree, so it overlaps with the transcript we’ve already looked at. This becomes important below.

Notice that the connection request also identifies an endpoint. This is different from our previous case, where an identity owner’s endpoint was discovered through lookup on the ledger. Here, Acme has decided to short-circuit the ledger and just directly publish its job application acceptor endpoint with each request. The Indy code base supports this.  Alice quickly works through the sequence of commands that establishes a new pairwise connection with Acme:
```
ALICE@sandbox> load sample/acme-job-application.indy
1 connection request found for Acme Corp.
Creating Connection for Acme Corp.

Try Next:
    show connection "Acme Corp"
    accept request from "Acme Corp"

The Proof is constructed from the following claims:

    Claim (Transcript v1.2 from Faber College)
          student_name: Alice Garcia
        * ssn: 123-45-6789
        * degree: Bachelor of Science, Marketing
          year: 2015
        * status: graduated


Try Next:
    set <attr-name> to <attr-value>
    send proof "Job-Application" to "Acme Corp"
```

Alice only has one claim that meets proof requirements for this Job Application, so it is associated automatically with the request; this is how some of her attributes are pre-populated.

The pre-population doesn’t create data leakage though; the request is still pending. Alice can edit what she is willing to supply for each requested attribute.

Notice that some attributes are verifiable and some are not. The proof request schema says that SSN, degree, and graduation status in the transcript must be formally asserted by an issuer other than Alice. Notice also that the first occurrence of first_name and last_name, plus the only occurrence of phone_number, are currently empty, and are not required to be verifiable. By not tagging these claims with a verifiable status, Acme’s claim request is saying it will accept Alice’s own claim about her names and phone numbers. (This might be done to allow Alice to provide a first name that’s a nickname, for example.) Alice therefore adds the extra attributes now:

```
ALICE@sandbox> set first_name to Alice
ALICE@sandbox> set last_name to Garcia
ALICE@sandbox> set phone_number to 123-456-7890
```

Alice checks to see what the proof request looks like now.

```
ALICE@sandbox> show proof request Job-Application
Found proof request "Job-Application" in connection "Acme Corp"
Status: Requested
Name: Job-Application
Version: 0.2
Attributes:
    first_name: Alice
    last_name: Garcia
    phone_number: 123-456-7890
    degree (V): Bachelor of Science, Marketing
    status (V): graduated
    ssn (V): 123-45-6789


The Proof is constructed from the following claims:

    Claim (Transcript v1.2 from Faber College)
          student_name: Alice Garcia
        * ssn: 123-45-6789
        * degree: Bachelor of Science, Marketing
          year: 2015
        * status: graduated


Try Next:
    set <attr-name> to <attr-value>
    send proof "Job-Application" to "Acme Corp"
```

She decides to submit.

```
ALICE@sandbox> send proof Job-Application to Acme

Signature accepted.

Response from Acme Corp (15.98 ms):
    Your Proof Job-Application 0.2 was received and verified

Response from Acme Corp (23.95 ms):
    Available Claim(s): Job-Certificate
```

It will be interesting to see whether Acme accepts this application with the informal first_name not matching the one on her transcript. If Acme is concerned about this discrepancy, it could reach out to Alice and ask about it, using the secure channel that’s now established. Alice could send a photo showing her college ID that lists her name as "Alice (Sally) Gonzales".

Here, we’ll assume the application is accepted, and Alice ends up getting the job. When Alice inspects her connection with Acme a week later, she sees that a new claim is available:

```
ALICE@sandbox> show connection Acme
Expanding Acme to "Acme Corp"

Try Next:
    show claim "Job-Certificate"
    request claim "Job-Certificate"
    show proof request "Job-Application"
    send proof "Job-Application" to "Acme Corp"
```

## Apply for a Loan

Now that Alice has a job, she’d like to apply for a loan. That will require proof of employment. She can get this from the Job-Certificate claim offered by Acme. Alice goes through a familiar sequence of interactions. First she inspects the claim:

```
ALICE@sandbox> show claim Job-Certificate
Found claim Job-Certificate in connection Acme Corp.
Status: available(not yet issued)
Name: Job-Certificate
Version: 0.2
Attributes:
    first_name
    last_name
    employement_status
    experience
    salary_bracket

Try Next:
    request claim "Job-Certificate"
```

Next, she requests it:

```
ALICE@sandbox> request claim Job-Certificate
Found claim Job-Certificate in connection Acme Corp
Requesting claim Job-Certificate from Acme Corp...

Signature accepted.

Response from Acme Corp (11.48 ms):
    Received claim "Job-Certificate".
```

The Job-Certificate has been issued, and she now has it in her possession.

```
ALICE@sandbox> show claim Job-Certificate
Found claim Job-Certificate in connection Acme Corp
Status: 2017-05-01 16:53:53.742695
Name: Job-Certificate
Version: 0.2
Attributes:
    first_name: Alice
    last_name: Garcia
    employee_status: Permanent
    experience: 3 years
    salary_bracket: between $50,000 to $100,000
```

She can use it when she applies for her loan, in much the same way that she used her transcript when applying for a job.

There is a disadvantage in this approach to data sharing though, -- it may disclose more data than what is strictly necessary. If all Alice needs to do is provide proof of employment, this can be done with an **anonymous credential** instead. Anonymous credentials may prove certain predicates without disclosing actual values (e.g., Alice is employed full-time, with a salary greater than X, along with her hire date, but her actually salary remains hidden).  A compound proof can be created, drawing from claims from both Faber College and Acme Corp, that discloses only what is necessary.

Alice now loads Thrift Bank's loan application connection:
```
ALICE@sandbox> load sample/thrift-loan-application.indy
1 connection request found for Thrift Bank.
Creating Connection for Thrift Bank.

Try Next:
    show connection "Thrift Bank"
    accept request from "Thrift Bank"
```

Alice accepts the loan application connection:

```
ALICE@sandbox> accept request from Thrift
Expanding thrift to "Thrift Bank"
Request not yet verified.
Connection not yet synchronized.

Response from Thrift Bank (1.59 ms):

    Confirmed DID written to Indy.

Try Next:
    show proof request "Loan-Application-Basic"
    send proof "Loan-Application-Basic" to "Thrift Bank"
    show proof request "Loan-Application-KYC"
    send proof "Loan-Application-KYC" to "Thrift Bank"
    show proof request "Name-Proof"
    send proof "Name-Proof" to "Thrift Bank"
```

Alice checks to see what the proof request "Loan-Application-Basic" looks like:
```
ALICE@sandbox> show proof request Loan-Application-Basic
Found proof request "Loan-Application-Basic" in connection "Thrift Bank"
Status: Requested
Name: Loan-Application-Basic
Version: 0.1
Attributes:
    salary_bracket (V): between $50,000 to $100,000
    employee_status (V): Permanent

The Proof is constructed from the following claims:

    Claim (Job-Certificate v0.2 from Acme Corp)
          first_name: Alice
          last_name: Garcia
        * employee_status: Permanent
          experience: 3 years
        * salary_bracket: between $50,000 to $100,000

Try Next:
    set <attr-name> to <attr-value>
    send proof "Loan-Application-Basic" to "Thrift Bank"
```

Alice sends just the "Loan-Application-Basic" proof to the bank. This allows her to minimize the **PII** (personally identifiable information) that she has to share when all she's trying to do right now is prove basic eligibility.

```
ALICE@sandbox> send proof Loan-Application-Basic to Thrift Bank

Signature accepted.

Response from Thrift Bank (479.17 ms):
    Your Proof Loan-Application-Basic 0.1 has been received and verified

    Loan eligibility criteria satisfied, please send another proof 'Loan-Application-KYC'
```

Alice now checks the second proof request where she needs to share her personal information with the bank.

```
ALICE@sandbox> show proof request Loan-Application-KYC
Found proof request "Loan-Application-KYC" in connection "Thrift Bank"
Status: Requested
Name: Loan-Application-KYC
Version: 0.1
Attributes:
    [2] first_name (V): Alice
    [2] last_name (V): Garcia
    [1] ssn (V): 123-45-6789

The Proof is constructed from the following claims:

    Claim [1] (Transcript v1.2 from Faber College)
          student_name: Alice Garcia
        * ssn: 123-45-6789
          degree: Bachelor of Science, Marketing
          year: 2015
          status: graduated

    Claim [2] (Job-Certificate v0.2 from Acme Corp)
        * first_name: Alice
        * last_name: Garcia
          employee_status: Permanent
          experience: 3 years
          salary_bracket: between $50,000 to $100,000

Try Next:
    set <attr-name> to <attr-value>
    send proof "Loan-Application-KYC" to "Thrift Bank"
```

Alice now sends "Loan-Application-KYC" proof to the bank:
```
ALICE@sandbox> send proof Loan-Application-KYC to Thrift Bank

Signature accepted.

Response from Thrift Bank (69.9 ms):
    Your Proof Loan-Application-KYC 0.1 has been received and verified
```

# Appendix

## Faber College Configures Transcripts

The following operations show how Transcripts are defined on the ledger, such that they can later be issued with reference to a known schema.
```
faber> use Schema-Wallet

faber> new schema
name = "Transcript"
version = "1.2"
attributes = {
    "student_name": "string",
    "ssn": "int",
    "degree": "string",
    "year": "int",
    "status": "string"
}

Schema Transcript v1 .2 added to Schema-Wallet

faber> add keys of type CL for schema Transcript version 1.2
Keys added

faber> show pending 2 pending
...
...
faber> submit pending Submitting 2 transactions...

Submitted.
```

## Acme Corp Defines a Job-Application

A similar process is followed by Acme Corp. to define a Job Application.

```
$ indy

            "degree": "string",
            "status": "string"
        }
    }]
}

Schema Job-Application v0 .1 added
