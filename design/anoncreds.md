    2. If the Issuer published a key at time A, and at time C he realised that the key was compromised at time B (A < B < C), then the Issuer should be able to rotate the key so that all credentials issued before time B can be successfully verified using old key, and all credentials issued between B and C becomes invalid.

### Technical goals
* Define how Schemas, CreDefs and RevocRegDefs are identified (seqNo, UUID, primary key tuples?)
* Define how to deal with Requirements 6.
* Define Revocation-related transactions and necessary changes in indy-node.


### Referencing Schema and CredDef in Credentials and Proofs
* Schema is referenced by unique `SchemaUUID`.
    * Created for each new Schema.
    * This is different from Schema Author DID (DID used to send `SCHEMA` txn) which can be the same for 
    any number of Schemas.
* CredDef is referenced by unique `CredDefUUID`.
    * Created for each new CredDef.
    * This is different from CredDef Issuer DID (DID used to send `CRED_DEF` txn) which can be the same for 
    any number of CredDef.
* RevocRegDef and RevocReg are referenced by unique `RevocRegDefUUID`.
    * Created for each new RevocRegDef.
    * Used to update RevocReg.
    * This is different from RevocRegDef Issuer DID (DID used to send `REVOC_REG_DEF` txn) which can be the same for 
    any number of RevocRegDef.
* Each `UUID` can be considered as a global UUID within the Ledger.
The Ledger can guarantee that malicious party can not change/break existing entity 
defined by a UUID by 
and checking if there is an entity with the given UUID already existent, plus
checking the ownership when modifying existing entities (only the issuer who created en entity with the given UUID can modify it). 

      
### How Prover and Verifier get keys for Credentials and Proofs
* Proofs and credentials come with `schemaUUID`, `credDefUUID`, `revocDefUUID`.
* Also there can be `issuanceTime` attribute in each credential (which can be disclosed in the proof).
* Prover/Verifier looks up SCHEMA using `GET_SCHEMA(schemaUUID)` request to the ledger
* Prover/Verifier looks up CRED_DEF using `GET_CRED_DEF(credDefUUID, issuanceTime)` request to the ledger
* Prover/Verifier looks up REVOC_REG_DEF using `GET_REVOC_REG_DEF(revocDefUUID, issuanceTime)` request to the ledger
* Prover looks up REVOC_REG to update the witness for the given `timestamp` 
 using `GET_REVOC_REG(revocDefUUID, timestamp)` request to the ledger
* Verifies looks up REVOC_REG to get accumulator value for the given `timestamp`  
 using `GET_REVOC_REG(revocDefUUID, timestamp)` request to the ledger
* Prover and Verifier should look up REVOC_REG by the same `timestamp` when generating and verifying the proof.

### Timestamp Support in State

We need to have a generic way to get the State at the given time.
- State Trie allows to go to the past, that is given the root hash, get the state with this root.
- We may have a mapping of each State update (timestamp) to the corresponding root.
- We need to find a data structure that can help us to find the nearest state timestamp (to get the root) for the given
time.
- So, we will be able to get the data (state) at the given time.

This approach can be used for
* getting `REVOC_REG` at desired time (the same for both proper and verifier),
possibly long ago in the past;
* dealing with Requirement 6. 

### Changes in Anoncreds Protocol

If want to support Requirement 6, then the following changes are required in the
anoncerds protocol:

* Each Credential must have a reserved mandatory attribute: `issuanceTime`.
    * It's set by the Issuer to specify the time of Issuance.
    * It's needed to fulfill Requirements 5.
* This attribute can be considered as `m3` special attribute (`m1` is master secret, `m2` is credential context, `m3` is issuance time).
* Since the Issuer may be malicious (if keys were compromised already), then 
a proof that `issuanceTime` is really the current time and not the time from the past is needed.
    * We can use our blockchain to prepare such a proof.
    * Issuer signs (by his Cred Def's public key) the `issuanceTime` and sends it to the pool.
    * Each node verifies that `issuanceTime` is not less that the current one, and signs the result with BLS key.
    * Each node then sends the signed result to the Issuer (no need to write anything to the ledger).
    * The issuer prepares a BLS multi-signature (making sure that there is a consensus)
    and adds the BLS-signed proof of the `issuanceTime` to the credential.
    * The verifier will then use the proof to make sure that the `issuanceTime` is really the correct one.
* The `issuanceTime` needs to be verified in each proof.
    * The Verifier should use Predicates (instead of disclosing) for the value of `issuanceTime`
    to avoid correlation. 
    * It's possible also to disclose `issuanceTime`, but we don't force it.
    * If it's not disclosed and not verified as a Predicate, then there is a chance the the proof verification will fail because of key rotations, since the latest keys will be used.



### SCHEMA

#### SCHEMA txn
```
{
    "data": {
        "uuid":"GEzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "attrNames": ["undergrad","last_name","first_name","birth_date","postgrad","expiry_date"],
        "name":"Degree",
        "version":"1.0",
    },
    
    "reqMetadata": {
        "issuerDid":"L5AD5g65TDQr1PPHHRoiGf",
        .....
    },
    
....
}
```
`uuid` is Schema's UUID. It's different from `issuerDid`.

#### Restrictions

* Existing Schema (identified by the Schema `uuid`) can be modified/changed/evolved.
* Only the `issuerDid` who created the Schema can modify it (that is we need to keep the ownership).
* It's not possible to create multiple entities with the same `uuid` (so, it's unique within the ledger). 

#### State

We need to have two records for Schema (one in State Trie and one in some cache key-value storage)
in order to have
1. Simple referencing of Schemas in the protocol (by Schema DID)
2. Requirements 8

Record 1 (State Trie):
* key: `schemaIssuerDid | SchemaMarker | schemaName | schemaVersion | schemaUUID` 
* value: aggregated txn data

Record 2 (Cache Storage):
* key: `schemaUUID`
* value: Record 1 key


#### GET_SCHEMA
```
{
    'data': {
        'uuid': 'GEzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd',
    },
...
}
```
1. Lookup Cache Storage to get `schemaIssuerDid | SchemaMarker |schemaName | schemaVersion | schemaUUID` by `uuid`
using Record2. 
1. Lookup State Trie to get data by the key found above (Record1).


### CRED_DEF

The Definition of credentials for the given Schema by the given Issuer.
It contains public keys (primary and revocation),
signature type and reference to the Schema. 

#### CRED_DEF txn
```
{
    "data": {
        "uuid":"TYzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "publicKeys": {},
        "schemaRef":"GEzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "signatureType":"CL",
        "oldKeyTrustTime": {                    (optional)
            "from": "10", 
            "to": "30",
        }
    },
    
    "reqMetadata": {
        "issuerDid":"HHAD5g65TDQr1PPHHRoiGf",
        .....
    },
    
....
}
```
* `uuid` is CredDef's UUID. It's different from `issuerDid`.
* `oldKeyTrustTime` can be set each time the key is rotated and defines
 `the intervals when we still can trust the previous value of the key`.
 This is delta; all intervals are accumulated and appended in the State. 
It is needed to deprecate credentials issued during the time when we suspect
the keys were stolen.
We can not always use revocation to deprecate old credentials, since revocation keys can
be stolen as well.  
 

#### Restrictions

* Existing CredDef (identified by the CredDef `uuid`) can be modified/changed/evolved.
That is rotation of keys is supported.
* Only the `issuerDID` created the CredDef can modify it (that is we need to keep the ownership). 
* It's not possible to create multiple entities with the same `uuid` (so, it's unique within the ledger).

#### State

We need to have two records for CredDef (one in State Trie and one in some cache key-value storage) in order to have
1. Simple referencing of CredDef in the protocol (by CredDef DID)
1. Requirements 8

Record 1 (State Trie):
* key: `credDefIssuerDid | CredDefMarker | schemaUUID | signatureType | credDefUUID` 
* value: aggregated txn data plus `trustTime` as an array (each next `trustTme` is appended).

Record 2 (Cache Storage):
* key: `credDefUUID`
* value: Record 1 key

#### How oldKeyTrustTime works
Let's assume that 
* `key1` was issued at `timeA`
* `key2` was issued at `timeC`, and we suspect that `key1` is stolen at `timeB`
* `key3` was issued at `timeE`, and we suspect that `key2` is stolen at `timeD`

So, we need to use (and return by `GET_CRED_DEF`) the following keys, depending on 
the interval the `issuanceTime` belongs to:
* [A,B] -> key1
* [B,C] -> key2 
* [C,D] -> key2
* [D,E] -> key3
* [E, current] -> key3

So, the Credentials issued at intervals [B,C] and [D,E], that is at intervals
when keys are suspicious, will not be verifiable anymore, because they were issued using key1 (key2),
but the Verifies will use key2 (key3) for verification (as returned by `GET_CRED_DEF`). 

The following txns will be put on Ledger:
1. At `timeA`:
 ```
 "data": {
        "uuid":"TYzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "publicKeys": {key1},
        "schemaRef":"GEzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "signatureType":"CL",
    },
```
2. At `timeC`:   
 ```
 "data": {
        "uuid":"TYzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "publicKeys": {key2},
        "schemaRef":"GEzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "signatureType":"CL",
        "oldKeyTrustTime": {          
            ("from": "A", "to": "B"),
            ("from": "C"),
        }
    },
```
3. At `timeE`:   
 ```
 "data": {
        "uuid":"TYzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "publicKeys": {key3},
        "schemaRef":"GEzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "signatureType":"CL",
        "oldKeyTrustTime": {          
            ("from": "C", "to": "D"),
            ("from": "E"),
        }
    },
```


The current state (Record1) will look the following:
* key: `HHAD5g65TDQr1PPHHRoiGf|CRED_DEF|GEzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd|CL|TYzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd`
* value:
 ```
 ....
 "data": {
        "uuid":"TYzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "publicKeys": {key3},
        "schemaRef":"GEzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "signatureType":"CL",
        "oldKeyTrustTime": {          
            ("from": "A", "to": "B"),
            ("from": "C", "to": "D"),
            ("from": "E"),
        }
    },
 ....
```
 
#### GET_CRED_DEF
```
{
    'data': {
        'uuid': 'TYzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd',
        'issuanceTime': 20, (optional)
    },
...
}
```
There is a special logic to get the valid and trusted value of the keys
depending on the issuance time:
1. Lookup Cache Storage to get `credDefIssuerDid | CredDefMarker | schemaUUID | signatureType | credDefUUID`  by `uuid`
using Record2. 
1. Lookup State Trie to get the current state by the key found above (Record1).
1. If no `issuanceTime` provided, then just return the current value.  
1. Try to find the interval (in `oldKeyTrustTime` array) the `issuanceTime` belongs to.
    * If it's greater than the most right interval, then return the current value.
    * If it belongs to an interval, then get the left value (`from`) of the interval.
    * If it's in between intervals, then get the right interval, and get the left value (`from`)
of this interval.
1. Use generic logic to get the root of the State trie at the time `to` found above. 
1. Lookup State Trie with the found root to find the state at that time (the same way as in Steps 1 and 2)

So, we will have not more than 2 lookups for each request. 

Result for the Example above:
* `issuanceTime < A` => [A,B] => state at timeA => key1 (OK)
* `A <= issuanceTime <= B` => [A,B] => state at timeA => key1 (OK)
* `B < issuanceTime < C` => [C,D] => state at timeC => key2 (deprecated credentials)
* `C <= issuanceTime <= D` => [C,D] => state at timeC => key2 (OK)
* `D < issuanceTime < E` => [E,...] => state at timeE => key3 (deprecated credentials)
* `issuanceTime > E` => [E,...] => state at timeE => key3 (OK)


### REVOC_REG_DEF

The Definition of revocation registry for the given CredDef.
It contains public keys, maximum number of credentials the registry may contain,
reference to the CredDef, plus some revocation registry specific data.

#### REVOC_REG_DEF txn
```
{
    "data": {
        "uuid":"ZXzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "type":"CL_ACCUM",
        "credDefRef":"GEzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "publicKeys": {},
        "maxCredNum": 1000000,
        "metadata": {
            "tailsHash": "<SHA256 hash>",
            "tailsLocation": "<URL>"
        }
        "oldKeyTrustTime": {                    (optional)
            "from": "10", 
            "to": "30",
        }
    },
    
    "reqMetadata": {
        "issuerDid":"MMAD5g65TDQr1PPHHRoiGf",
        .....
    },
    
....
}
```
* `uuid` is RevocRegDef's UUID. It's different from `issuerDid`.
* `oldKeyTrustTime` can be set each time the accumulator key is rotated and defines
 `the interval when we still can trust the previous value of the key`. 
It is needed to deprecate credentials issued during the time when we suspect
the keys were stolen.
We can not always use revocation to deprecate old credentials, since revocation keys can
be stolen as well.  
 

#### Restrictions

* Existing RevocRegDef (identified by the RevocRegDef `uuid`) can be modified/changed/evolved.
That is rotation of keys is supported.
* Only the `issuerDid` who created the RevocRegDef can modify it (that is we need to keep the ownership). 
* It's not possible to create multiple entities with the same `uuid` (so, it's unique within the ledger).

#### State

We need to have two records for RevocRegDef (one in State Trie and one in some cache key-value storage) in order to have
1. Simple referencing of RevocRegDef in the protocol (by RevocRegDef DID)
1. Requirements 8

Record 1 (State Trie):
* key: `revocDefIssuerDid | RevocRefMarker | credDefUUID | revocDefUUID` 
* value: aggregated txn data plus `trustTime` as an array (each next `trustTme` is appended).

Record 2 (Cache Storage):
* key: `revocDefUUID`
* value: Record 1 key


#### GET_REVOC_REG_DEF
```
{
    'data': {
        'uuid': 'ZXzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd',
        'issuanceTime': 20, (optional)
    },
...
}
```
The logic is the same as for `GET_CLAIM_DEF` (involving Record1, Record2 and `issuanceTime`).


### REVOC_REG

The delta of the RevocReg current state (accumulator, issued and revoked indices, etc.).

#### REVOC_REG txn
```
{
    "data": {
        "uuid":"ZXzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "type": "<issued by default or not>"
        "accum":"<accum_value>",
        "issued": [], (optional)
        "revoked": [],
    },
    
    "reqMetadata": {
        "issuerDid":"MMAD5g65TDQr1PPHHRoiGf",
        .....
    },
    
....
}
```
* `uuid` must match an existing `REVOC_REG_DEF` with the given UUID.
* `type`: issuance by default (`issued` will be empty in this case assuming that everything is already issued)
or issuance by request (`issued` will be fulfilled by newly issued indices).
* `issued`: an array of issued indices (may be absent/empty if the type is "issuance by default"); this is delta; will be accumulated in state.
* `revoked`: an array of revoked indices (delta; will be accumulated in state)

#### Restrictions

* Existing RevocReg (identified by the RevocRegDef's `uuid`) can be modified/changed/evolved.
* Only the `issuerDid` who created the corresponding `REVOC_REG_DEF` can modify it. 


#### State

* key: `revocDefUUID` 
* value: aggregated txn data (aggregated accum_value, issued and revoked arrays)


#### GET_REVOC_REG
```
{
    'data': {
        'uuid': 'ZXzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd',
        'timestamp': 20,
    },
...
}
```
1. Use generic logic to get the root of the State trie at the time `timestamp`. 
2. Lookup State Trie with the found root to find the state for `uuid`.
