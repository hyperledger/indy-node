## Referencing Anoncreds Entities

<b>Reqs 4</b>

The proposed solution is to identify entities by a unique `id`.
 * State-Trie-based key will be used as `id`. 
 This is the actual key used to store the entities in Patricia Merkle State Trie.
 * It can be deterministically calculated from the primary key tuples (by the client).
 * This single value will be used in anoncreds protocol (in libindy) to identify entities.
 * This ID should be included in all transactions as a new field (`id`).
 * We may expect changes in the format of this field, so it's not just address (key)
 in the State Trie, but can be a descriptive identifier.
 * The `id` attribute is calculated by the client and send as a part of SCHEMA/CRED_DEF/REVOC_REG_DEF txns.
 The ledger doesn't use this key as it is for storing the data in the State Trie.
 The ledger also calculates the key on its side from the primary key tuples, compares it with the provided `id`,
 and orders it only if they match. The request is rejected if they don't match.
 * We need to support [`GET_OBJ`](.get_obj) request to get the current state of the Schema/CredDef/RevocReg by its `id`.

      
## SCHEMA 

<b>Reqs 1, 4, 8</b>

#### SCHEMA txn
```
{
    "data": {

## Timestamp Support in State

<b>Reqs 6, 7</b>

We need to have a generic way to get the State at the given time.
- State Trie allows to go to the past, that is given the root hash, get the state with this root.
- We may have a mapping of each State update (timestamp) to the corresponding root.
- We need to find a data structure that can help us to find the nearest state timestamp (to get the root) for the given
time.
- So, we will be able to get the data (state) at the given time.

This approach can be used for
* getting `REVOC_REG_ENTRY` at desired time (the same for both proper and verifier),
possibly long ago in the past;
* dealing with Requirement 6. 

<b>Example</b>:
* There are the following entries (in key-value storage): 
    * `ts1` - `root1`
    * `ts2` - `root2`
* We need to find the nearest root for ts3, where `ts1 < ts3 < ts2`.
    * So, we need to return `root1`


## Issuer Key Rotation

<b>Reqs 6</b>

#### Changes in Anoncreds Protocol

If want to support Requirement 6, then the following changes are required in the
anoncerds protocol:

* Each Credential must have a reserved mandatory attribute: `issuanceTime`.
    * It's set by the Issuer to specify the time of Issuance.
    * It's needed to fulfill Requirements 5.
* This attribute can be considered as `m3` special attribute (`m1` is master secret, `m2` is credential context, `m3` is issuance time).
* Since the Issuer may be malicious (if keys were compromised already), then 
a proof that `issuanceTime` is really the current time and not the time from the past is needed.
    * We can use our blockchain to prepare such a proof.
    * Issuer signs (by his Cred Def's public key) the `issuanceTime` and sends it to the pool.
    * Each node verifies that `issuanceTime` is not less that the current one, and signs the result with BLS key.
    * Each node then sends the signed result to the Issuer (no need to write anything to the ledger).
    * The issuer prepares a BLS multi-signature (making sure that there is a consensus)
    and adds the BLS-signed proof of the `issuanceTime` to the credential.
    * The verifier will then use the proof to make sure that the `issuanceTime` is really the correct one.
* The `issuanceTime` needs to be verified in each proof.
    * The Verifier should use Predicates (instead of disclosing) for the value of `issuanceTime`
    to avoid correlation. 
    * It's possible also to disclose `issuanceTime`, but we don't force it.
    * If it's not disclosed and not verified as a Predicate, then there is a chance the the proof verification will fail because 
of key rotations, since the latest keys will be used.

#### Changes in Transactions
A new field `oldKeyTrustTime` needs to be added to `CRED_DEF` and `REVOC_REF_DEF` txns.
`oldKeyTrustTime` can be set each time a key is rotated and defines
 `the intervals when we still can trust the previous value of the key`. 
It is needed to deprecate credentials issued during the time when we suspect
the keys were stolen.
We can not always use revocation to deprecate old credentials, since revocation keys can
be stolen as well.  


#### How oldKeyTrustTime works
Let's assume that 
* `key1` was issued at `timeA`
* `key2` was issued at `timeC`, and we suspect that `key1` is stolen at `timeB`
* `key3` was issued at `timeE`, and we suspect that `key2` is stolen at `timeD`

So, we need to use (and return by `GET_CRED_DEF`) the following keys, depending on 
the interval the `issuanceTime` belongs to:
* [A,B] -> key1
* [B,C] -> key2 
* [C,D] -> key2
* [D,E] -> key3
* [E, current] -> key3

So, the Credentials issued at intervals [B,C] and [D,E], that is at intervals
when keys are suspicious, will not be verifiable anymore, because they were issued using key1 (key2),
but the Verifies will use key2 (key3) for verification (as returned by `GET_CRED_DEF`). 

The following txns will be put on Ledger:
1. At `timeA`:
 ```
 "data": {
        "uuid":"TYzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "publicKeys": {key1},
        "schemaRef":"GEzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "signatureType":"CL",
    },
```
2. At `timeC`:   
 ```
 "data": {
        "uuid":"TYzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "publicKeys": {key2},
        "schemaRef":"GEzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "signatureType":"CL",
        "oldKeyTrustTime": {          
            ("from": "A", "to": "B"),
            ("from": "C"),
        }
    },
```
3. At `timeE`:   
 ```
 "data": {
        "uuid":"TYzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "publicKeys": {key3},
        "schemaRef":"GEzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "signatureType":"CL",
        "oldKeyTrustTime": {          
            ("from": "C", "to": "D"),
            ("from": "E"),
        }
    },
```


The current state (Record1) will look the following:
* key: `HHAD5g65TDQr1PPHHRoiGf|CRED_DEF|GEzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd|CL|TYzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd`
* value:
 ```
 ....
 "data": {
        "uuid":"TYzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "publicKeys": {key3},
        "schemaRef":"GEzcdDLhCpGCYRHW82kjHd",
        "signatureType":"CL",
        "oldKeyTrustTime": {          
            ("from": "A", "to": "B"),
            ("from": "C", "to": "D"),
            ("from": "E"),
        }
    },
 ....
```

#### Changes in GET request

An optional field `issuanceTime` needs to be supported for 
* `GET_CRED_DEF`
* `GET_REVOC_REG_DEF`
* `GET_OBJ`.

There is a special logic to get the valid and trusted value of the keys
depending on the issuance time:
1. Lookup State Trie to get the current state by the key (either `id` in case of `GET_OBJ` or a key created
from primary key fields provided in the request).
1. If no `issuanceTime` provided, then just return the current value.  
1. Try to find the interval (in `oldKeyTrustTime` array) the `issuanceTime` belongs to.
    * If it's greater than the most right interval, then return the current value.
    * If it belongs to an interval, then get the left value (`from`) of the interval.
    * If it's in between intervals, then get the right interval, and get the left value (`from`)
of this interval.
1. Use generic logic to get the root of the State trie at the time `to` found above. 
1. Lookup State Trie with the found root to find the state at that time (the same way as in Step 1)

So, we will have not more than 2 lookups for each request. 

Result for the Example above:
* `issuanceTime < A` => [A,B] => state at timeA => key1 (OK)
* `A <= issuanceTime <= B` => [A,B] => state at timeA => key1 (OK)
* `B < issuanceTime < C` => [C,D] => state at timeC => key2 (deprecated credentials)
* `C <= issuanceTime <= D` => [C,D] => state at timeC => key2 (OK)
* `D < issuanceTime < E` => [E,...] => state at timeE => key3 (deprecated credentials)
* `issuanceTime > E` => [E,...] => state at timeE => key3 (OK)
